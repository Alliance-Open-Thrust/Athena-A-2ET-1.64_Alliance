This is the repository for the Alliance Edition Release of the legacy to the community of makers from Neva Aerospace Ltd (UK) for the Athena Static Thrust Electric Ducted Fan (EDF) (Electric Turbine) ((Turbine électrique de poussée statique).
The Athena-A-2ET- is a 2 stages contra-rotative elecric ducted fan optimised for static thrust (hovering) in atmospheric conditions with maximum linear speed under 50kph (30mph).

The maximum thrust last checked in 2023 where between 3.7kgf to 4.1Kgf. It depends on the make of the Athena with 6S motors (2x550W) and 3D printed parts.

# About 3D Printing
All 3D printed parts must be in Polycarbonate in order to sustain mechanical constraints and temperature.
Only blades can be Printed in PLA with epoxy light coating.
All rotors must be balanced after assembly before mounting to the turbine.
